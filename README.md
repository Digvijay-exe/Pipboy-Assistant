# Pipboy Assistant 🖥️

Pipboy is an AI-powered desktop assistant built with **Python** and the **Groq API**, designed to provide quick and intelligent responses in a retro-futuristic style.  
It features a minimal **Tkinter-based GUI**, neon blue-on-black theme, and can be extended with voice input/output.  

---

## 💡 Inspiration
With the theme of **Smart City**, we wanted to create a personal digital assistant that helps users interact with AI in a simple and reliable way.  
Pipboy was built as a lightweight, offline-ready prototype that feels like a futuristic tool for every citizen.

## ✨ Features
- Clean **desktop GUI** built with Tkinter  
- **Dark mode terminal look** with neon-blue text  
- Real-time AI responses via **Groq API**  
- Expandable for **voice input/output**  
- Offline-ready design (can integrate with local models later)  

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It
1. Designed GUI using **Tkinter**  
2. Integrated **Groq API** for LLM-based responses  
3. Styled the interface with a retro dark-theme  
4. Added threading for smooth, non-blocking responses  
5. Expanded with optional **speech synthesis**

## 🚧 Challenges
- Handling API response speed for smooth UX  
- Designing a retro-futuristic interface in Tkinter  
- Balancing simplicity with expandability (voice + offline mode)  

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Built a **working desktop AI assistant** in under 48 hours  
- Achieved smooth GUI + AI integration  
- Created a retro yet modern user experience  

---

## 📚 What We Learned
We explored **API integration, GUI design, and threading in Python**, while learning how to balance design, usability, and performance in a hackathon setting.  

---

## 🔮 What’s Next
- **Offline mode** using local models (LM Studio, Ollama, or GPT4All)  
- Add **voice input/output** for full hands-free usage  
- Extend smart city integration (directions, weather, utilities info)
